Testing the web interface with a comprehensive sample resume and job description to validate the complete workflow.

For testing purposes, I would use:
1. A sample PDF resume (which would need to be uploaded via the web interface)
2. A sample job description
3. Test different interview types and difficulty levels

Since we can't create actual PDF files in this environment, let me create a basic test file to simulate the workflow, and then create additional UI improvements.
